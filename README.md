# Avatar: The Last Airbender - Roleplay Game

This is a solution to the Build a Role-playing Game on Scrimba (https://scrimba.com/learn/buildrpg).

I took the liberty of making this project my own by making it an Avatar Card Game.

This project is a web-based roleplay game inspired by the beloved cartoon series, "Avatar: The Last Airbender". It's an interactive, dynamic game where players navigate through the rich world of Avatar, engaging in battles using a unique card and dice system.

## My process

### Built with

    - HTML5 and CSS3 for structure and styling.
    - Vanilla JavaScript for game logic and interactions.
    - Audio integration for an immersive experience.

### What I learned

In developing this Avatar-themed game, I delved into several new areas:

    1. Working with Constructors: This was my first project utilizing constructors in JavaScript. It was challenging to adapt to this new way of thinking, but it allowed for more organized and scalable code, especially when managing multiple characters in the game.

    2. Balancing Game Mechanics: I experimented with health and dice counts to ensure varied and balanced gameplay. It took some trial and error to represent each character accurately and maintain an unpredictable game outcome.

    3. Audio Integration: Incorporating music from the series was an enjoyable aspect, enhancing the game's ambiance and providing a more engaging user experience.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I aim to:

    - Enhance Animation: Add animations for actions like dice rolling to make the gameplay more visually appealing.
    - Expand Interactivity: I plan to include more interactive elements to make the game even more engaging.
